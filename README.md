# VR API

## What?

This mod serves to act as an API for Vivecraft, to allow mod developers to interface with VR-specific features.

## How?

### Setup

Since this mod is still heavily work in progress and barely tested, I am not providing any methods to integrate this library/API mod into actual mods. Long term, it will be able to be added to `build.gradle` similarly to other library mods.

### Documentation

More thorough documentation will be written here (or maybe on a GitHub wiki). It will be added once this mod isn't under heavy development. Until then, you can look at the docstrings, they're intended to be good enough without any other documentation.

## Why?

To make my own mods (and hopefully other people's mods) work better in the context of VR, and to allow for the creation of VR-specific mods, by both others and me.

## Some Questions and Answers

#### Q: How about 1.17/1.18 and higher?

A: The developers of Vivecraft plan to create an official API. For that reason, I have no reason or need to port this up to 1.17/1.18. If said official API is ever released for 1.16, this API will be discontinued.

#### Q: Fabric?

A: No. Vivecraft is based on Forge, so this API is only for Forge. I have no plans to write this for MCXR, and MCXR plans to have an official API anyways.
